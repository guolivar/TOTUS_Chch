TOTUS is a very flexible system that can be configured to use several different data layers but the minimum expected are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Traffic network}. The road network is defined using data from the Open Street Map (OSM) project\cite{dummy_temp}\todo{Add reference to OSM project}.
	\item \textbf{Traffic data}. As a long term planning and assessment tool, TOTUS expects data from a strategic traffic model for information about the traffic flows on the network and the fleet composition.
	\item \textbf{Demographic data}. The third data source is the census information that should cover the same geographical area as the traffic network data.
\end{itemize}
