\subsubsection*{Routing engine}
A key component of the TOTUS system is its routing engine. It enables some of the most powerful features in TOTUS like trip-dependent exposure and energy calculation as well as route optimisation based on arbitrary cost functions (e.g. minimum distance or energy). This module is implemented based on pgRouting (vXX\todo{pgRouting version?})\cite{dummy_temp}\todo{citation needed pgRouting}. The implementation of this module takes a streamlined version of the Open Street Map \cite{dummy_temp}\todo{OSM ref} data schema and converts it into a directed graph using \textit{osmosis}\cite{dummy_temp} and \textit{osm2pgrouting}\cite{dummy_temp}. The routing information is kept on a separate data schema that can be linked to the physical road network by the unique OSM feature identifier. From a scenario evaluation point of view, the advantages of the database routing approach for TOTUS are that the spatial data and attributes can be modified and any data changes can be reflected instantaneously through the routing engine. 

\subsubsection*{Exposure}
The current version of TOTUS' exposure module is based on a \textit{Traffic Impact Factor} developed by Longley et al\cite{dummy_temp}\todo{Citation needed TIF} to model $NO_2$ on a arbitrary grid covering a city. The method calculates, for a given point, an estimate of the impact of traffic from all the roads in the domain. This is applied to the centres of the grid cells. The following diagram describes the calculations. For more details see Longley et al\cite{dummy_temp}\todo{Citation needed TIF}

\begin{equation}
TIF_{x,y} = \sum_{road=1}^{R}{(Length_{road}*Traffic_{road})^{exp}}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection*{Energy}

This module enables the implementation of an energy consumption calculator for any arbitrary census area (from meshblock to country) based on any arbitrary metric available for such census area. The implementation of the energy consumption model is flexible and allows for the interactive generation of various scenarios. 

In simple terms, the module only stores the \textit{metadata} needed to configure a model run in terms of its identifier ( \textit{activity} and \textit{scenario}) and the specific model definition (and its parts). The definition is stored in the \textit{model\_definition} table while \textit{model\_definition\_part} defines the individual parts of the equation (see Equation \ref{eq:energy}) that are aggregated to produce a final intensity
value. Each model definition part is described by a demographic data and the coefficient to apply. Figure \ref{fig:energy_diag} shows an overview of the Energy data schema.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:energy}
EI=\sum_{parts}{CensusData_1*C_1+CensusData_2^{C_2}}
\end{equation}
