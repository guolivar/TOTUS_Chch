To demonstrate the functionality and capabilities of the TOTUS framework, we focused on the city of Christchurch, New Zealand (43°31′48″S, 172°37′13″E) that over the past few years has suffered dramatic changes to its natural and urban landscape as the result of significant earthquakes. These changes in the urban form of Christchurch were evaluated in terms of changes in the long term exposure to traffic pollution as well as total energy use.

To evaluate the impact of the 2011 earthquakes we set up a TOTUS instance for Christchurch using the STRATEGIC TRANSPORT MODEL\todo{find real name} to estimate the changes in long term transport patterns in the city.

The pre-earthquake scenario was built with 2011 forecast data.

The post-earthquake scenario was built with 2011 forecast data forced with the post-earthquake land use changes.
