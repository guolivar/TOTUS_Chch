This document described the TOTUS data system and how it can be used to quantify the energy consumption and air pollution exposure outcomes that resulted from changes due to the earthquakes in Christchurch during 2011.

The system was shown to be flexible, robust and to provide a useful framework to quantify exposure and energy consumption impacts.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Differences pre-post earthquake
	\item changes in transport energy
	\item changes in emissions
	\item changes in exposure
\end{itemize}
